# COMPLETE LLMOps ROADMAP (BEGINNER → ADVANCED)

Welcome to the **COMPLETE LLMOps ROADMAP (BEGINNER → ADVANCED)** repository! This roadmap is designed to guide aspiring and current engineers through the essential concepts and practices required to become a production-ready LLMOps Engineer.

---

## Duration & Goal

*   **Duration**: ~120 Days (16 Weeks)
*   **Goal**: Become a Production-Ready LLMOps Engineer

---

## What Is LLMOps?

LLMOps stands for Engineering + Operations for Large Language Models. It is a critical discipline for moving LLM prototypes from a notebook environment into reliable, scalable, and secure production systems.

Key areas covered in this roadmap include:

*   LLM application architecture
*   Prompt & model lifecycle
*   Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
*   Inference optimization
*   Monitoring, evaluation & cost control
*   Secure, scalable deployment

## Roadmap Structure & Phases

This roadmap is structured into four distinct 30-day phases, progressing from foundational knowledge to advanced, production-level skills, culminating in a final capstone project.

The detailed learning path for each phase will be available in linked Markdown files below:

---

### [PHASE 1 — LLM & AI Fundamentals](PHASE_1_FOUNDATIONS.md)

*   **Duration:** Days 1–30
*   **Goal:** Understand how LLMs actually work and build foundational AI knowledge.

### [PHASE 2 — LLM Application Engineering](PHASE_2_RAG_SYSTEMS.md)

*   **Duration:** Days 31–60
*   **Goal:** Build real, functional LLM-powered systems and explore RAG architectures.

### [PHASE 3 — LLMOps (Production & Scaling)](PHASE_3_PRODUCTION.md)

*   **Duration:** Days 61–90
*   **Goal:** Learn how to operate, monitor, and scale LLM systems in a production environment.

### [PHASE 4 — Cloud, CI/CD & Scaling](PHASE_4_ENTERPRISE.md)

*   **Duration:** Days 91–110
*   **Goal:** Implement enterprise-grade LLMOps using robust cloud infrastructure.

---

## FINAL CAPSTONE — END-TO-END LLMOps SYSTEM

*   **Duration:** Days 111–120

The final stage of the roadmap involves a comprehensive capstone project where you will build a production-ready LLMOps platform integrating all learned concepts.

### System Features

The goal is to implement a robust system with the following features:

*   RAG-based knowledge assistant
*   AI agent with tools
*   Prompt & model versioning
*   Evaluation & monitoring
*   Cost tracking
*   Guardrails & security
*   CI/CD automation
*   Cloud deployment (AWS)

### The Stack

We will utilize industry-standard tools and frameworks:

*   **LLM APIs:** OpenAI / Claude
*   **Frameworks:** LangChain / LangGraph
*   **Vector DBs:** Qdrant / FAISS
*   **Backend:** FastAPI
*   **Experiment Tracking:** MLflow
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform
*   **Cloud Platform:** AWS ECS/EKS
