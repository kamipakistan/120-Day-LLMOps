## What Is LLMOps?

LLMOps stands for Engineering + Operations for Large Language Models. It is a critical discipline for moving LLM prototypes from a notebook environment into reliable, scalable, and secure production systems.

Key areas covered in this roadmap include:

*   LLM application architecture
*   Prompt & model lifecycle
*   Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
*   Inference optimization
*   Monitoring, evaluation & cost control
*   Secure, scalable deployment

## Roadmap Structure

This roadmap is divided into sequential phases, progressing from foundational knowledge to advanced, production-level skills. The file you are currently reading serves as the project's introduction. The detailed learning path will be available in subsequent, linked Markdown files (e.g., `PHASE_1_FOUNDATIONS.md`, `PHASE_2_RAG_SYSTEMS.md`, etc.).

Stay tuned as we build out the detailed curriculum, resources, and hands-on projects for each phase!

## Getting Started

If you are a complete beginner, start with the foundations phase when it is available. If you have existing ML/AI experience, you may jump ahead to specific areas of interest.

We encourage contributions! If you would like to suggest resources or improvements to this roadmap, please check out the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
